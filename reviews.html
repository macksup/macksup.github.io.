                <a>Had a very delicious lunch with my three children today. Cafe is bright and clean, staff was courteous, and our food was amazing. I had the chicken salad and apple melt, my girls had grilled cheese, and we shared a bowl of the creamed tomato soup which was TO DIE FOR. We also shared biscotti and a slice of lemon-blueberry cheesecake that was top notch. A little expensive for a daily/weekly visit, but I don't mind paying for excellent food and service every now and then.<br> <i>-Ronda from Waynesville NC, age 43</i></a>

                <a>I absolutely love this place. The staff is always friendly and professional. Clean, cozy place to hang out, and can be accompanied with an amazing coffee or tasty meal. Stop by about every week.<br><i> -Kent from Clyde NC, age 55</i></a>
